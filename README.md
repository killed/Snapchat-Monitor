# Setup

I will not help you on setting this program up if you know how to set it up then you're worthy of using it.

Inside the RAR file you'll find a file called `config.json` inside there you'll see the information it'll want

At the moment it'll tell you if you receive a live snapchat or a picture/video in chat but you won't be able to see it.
All messages you receive will get saved to a txt file.
